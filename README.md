What is Threat Modelling?
Threat modelling is a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and addressing potential security threats across the organization. By simulating possible attack scenarios and assessing the existing vulnerabilities of the organization's interconnected systems and applications, threat modelling enables organizations to develop proactive security measures and make informed decisions about resource allocation. Threat modelling aims to reduce an organization's overall risk exposure by identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, allowing for adequate security controls and strategies. This process is essential for constructing a robust defense strategy against the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.

Threat, Vulnerability and Risk
As mentioned above, the main goal of threat modelling is to reduce the organization's risk exposure. So before we deep dive into its application, let's review first the definitions of Threat, Vulnerability and Risk.

Type	Definition
Threat	Refers to any potential occurrence, event, or actor that may exploit vulnerabilities to compromise information confidentiality, integrity, or availability. It may come in various forms, such as cyber attacks, human error, or natural disasters.
Vulnerability	A weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that may be exploited by a threat to cause harm. It may arise from software bugs, misconfiguration, or design flaws.
Risk	The possibility of being compromised because of a threat taking advantage of a vulnerability. A way to think about how likely an attack might be successful and how much damage it could cause.

Applying MITRE ATT&CK in Threat Modelling Process
MITRE ATT&CK can be integrated into our threat modelling process by mapping the identified threats and vulnerabilities to the tactics and techniques described in the ATT&CK Framework. We can insert a new entry in our methodology after the "Identify Threats" step.

Identify Threats
Identify potential threats that may impact the identified assets, such as cyber attacks, physical attacks, social engineering, and insider threats.

Map to MITRE ATT&CK 
Map the identified threats to the corresponding tactics and techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. For each mapped technique, utilize the information found on the corresponding ATT&CK technique page, such as the description, procedure examples, mitigations, and detection strategies, to gain a deeper understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities in your system.

Incorporating the framework in our threat modelling process ensures a comprehensive understanding of the potential security threats. It enables a better application of countermeasures to reduce the overall risk to your organization.
